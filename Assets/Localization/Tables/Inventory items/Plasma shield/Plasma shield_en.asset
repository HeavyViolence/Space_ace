    m_Localized: Contains a powerful magnetic field generator, prefabricated fusion
      power source, and lots of cold plasma cells. The generator guides freed plasma
      to form a shell around the ship. Plasma is kept in place and gets superheated
      by a magnetic field to evaporate any projectiles that hit it. Magnetic field
      also slows player projectiles as the plasma field needs to be safely guided
      around them in real time. Such system is proven to be able to provide a great
      defensive capabilities for its carrier for a short duration.
