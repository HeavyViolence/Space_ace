    m_Localized: Contains a thin and pliant piezo kinetic shroud made out of a metamaterial
      known as "custodium". Its lattice consists of highly reactive domain particles
      that are bounded together by a pre applied magnetic field and suspended inside
      a carbon nanotube confinement. Such material has ever increasing resistance
      to any mechanical effects and wear. The harder you strain it, the stronger
      it will become, only accumulating all the energy applied to break it in a form
      of a magnetic field. This material was reverse-engineered from an unknown indestructible
      piece of space debris. Though rare and hard to manufacture, it is a crucial
      component in high-end active armor production. Any ship wielding such armor
      shroud has to move slower in order to mitigate electromagnetic interference
      of the armor inflicted on the ship systems.
