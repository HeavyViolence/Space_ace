    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 568147169280
    m_Localized: Military grade field all-around repair kit. Contains common hull
      components and fasteners, as well as automatic tooling. Designed to be used
      under combat conditions.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 6328642031616
    m_Localized: Contains a powerful magnetic field generator, prefabricated fusion
      power source, and lots of cold plasma cells. The generator guides freed plasma
      to form a shell around the ship. Plasma is kept in place and gets superheated
      by a magnetic field to evaporate any projectiles that hit it. Magnetic field
      also slows player projectiles as the plasma field needs to be safely guided
      around them in real time. Such system is proven to be able to provide a great
      defencive capabilityes for its carrier for a short duration.

    m_Localized: High-power gamma emitter is used to erode the top layers armor,
      hard meteor crust, or dense and petrified space debris. Once affected, entities
      will keep their topmost layers weak and unstable unconditionally long. A perfect
      weapon to soften someone's malitious mind.

    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 11568242085888
    m_Localized: Contains a thin and pliant piezo kinetic shroud made out of a metamaterial
      known as "custodium". Its lattice consists of highly reactive domain particles
      that are bounded together by a pre applied magnetic field and suspended inside
      a carbon nanotube confinement. Such material has ever increasing resistance
      to any mechanical effects and wear. The harder you strain it, the stronger
      it will become, only accumulating all the energy applied to break it in a form
      of a magnetic field. This material was reverse-engineered from an unknown indestructible
      piece of space debris. Though rare and hard to manufacture, it is a crucial
      component in high-end active armor production. Any ship wielding such armor
      shroud has to move slower in order to mitigate electromagnetic interference
      of the armor inflicted on the ship systems.

    m_Localized: A container with special antimatter tips for projectiles and propellable
      ammo. Allows any ammo to matter, no matter how naught it is. Each consecutive
      hit of the same target deals increasingly more damage, but hitting a different
      one resets the effect.

  - m_Id: 33332284215296
    m_Localized: A container with lots of disposable kits that consist of small casings
      with thrusters and tracking equipment. Suitable to convert pretty much any
      projectiles into a homing one for a short period of time.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 37490496229376
    m_Localized: A set of super magnetic coils in replacement of a regular ones for
      gunning equipment. Allows to increase speed and damage of projectiles at a
      cost of gun capacitors longer recharge duration.

  - m_Id: 37857653018624
    m_Localized: Liquid hydrogen fuel tank. Used to replace common coolant in gunning
      equipment to increase fire rate and reduce cooldowns. Cannot be used constantly
      as the barrels tend to strain beyound the safe threshold, and become brittle
      from frequent, intense temperature gradients.

  - m_Id: 510179107262464
    m_Localized: Electromagnetic pulse generator adjusted to target weapons capacitors.
      Frequent and accurate electromagnetic shock bursts polarize capacitors, effectively
      forcing them to lose the ability to accumulate electric charge. This in turn
      leads to railgun power depletion and projectile acceleration failure. The more
      powerful the bursts, the greater the chance of success.

  - m_Id: 514869421264896
    m_Localized: Extends a combat beacon from the player ship. It will emit powerful
      noise waves of all frequencies and in all directions, and will greatly increase
      radar signature of the ship. Use this if you are not sure that everyone saw
      you coming, but notice that your own radar will not stand a chance before such
      a device.

    m_Localized: An irreversible gamma sequencer powered by fusion power cells. Completely
      annihilates the target on charge no matter what. The technology was developed
      to allow allied ships to regroup, retreat, or repair itself under combat conditions
      while being able to fight back from a safe range.

      equipment work together to bring more asteroids closer to a miner. Thanks to
      this technology there is no need to search for asteroids. The asteroids will
      search for you.

  - m_Id: 1800560398684160
    m_Localized: High-frequency impulse scanners most commonly found aboard mining
      ships. They require substantial power to operate properly and precise signature
      maps, but in return reward their users with accurate ore ping in asteroid fields
      or on planets.

      equipment, once wired into your ship, will transmit all actions to someone
      really interested in watching them over. Who knows who they are? The only thing
      you know they will pay you for any fiery action you will take. Time to impress
